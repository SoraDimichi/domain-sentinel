# Domain Sentinel Implementation Timeline

This document outlines the recommended implementation timeline for the domain-sentinel-chrome and domain-sentinel-webkit microservices.

## Phase 1: Setup and Infrastructure (Week 1)

### Days 1-2: Project Setup
- [ ] Create the domain-sentinel-chrome and domain-sentinel-webkit project structures
- [ ] Set up the basic NestJS modules and configurations
- [ ] Install required dependencies (Playwright, nestjs-playwright, etc.)
- [ ] Create the feed schema migration
- [ ] Update nest-cli.json to include the new microservices

### Days 3-5: Infrastructure Setup
- [ ] Create Dockerfiles for both microservices
- [ ] Update docker-compose.yml to include the new microservices
- [ ] Set up Kafka configuration for consuming domain batches
- [ ] Configure TypeORM for database access
- [ ] Create the domain warning feed entity

## Phase 2: Core Implementation (Week 2)

### Days 1-2: Domain Consumer Implementation
- [ ] Implement domain batch consumer in Chrome microservice
- [ ] Implement domain batch consumer in WebKit microservice
- [ ] Set up message parsing and validation
- [ ] Implement error handling and logging

### Days 3-5: Browser Integration
- [ ] Implement Playwright integration for Chrome
- [ ] Implement Playwright integration for WebKit
- [ ] Configure browser launch options
- [ ] Set up page navigation and timeout handling
- [ ] Implement browser context management

## Phase 3: Warning Detection and Processing (Week 3)

### Days 1-3: Warning Detection
- [ ] Research and identify Chrome-specific warning page elements
- [ ] Research and identify WebKit-specific warning page elements
- [ ] Implement warning detection logic for Chrome
- [ ] Implement warning detection logic for WebKit
- [ ] Add logging and error handling

### Days 4-5: Domain Processing
- [ ] Implement domain processor service for Chrome
- [ ] Implement domain processor service for WebKit
- [ ] Set up feed schema update logic
- [ ] Implement result storage in database
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging

## Phase 4: Testing and Deployment (Week 4)

### Days 1-3: Testing
- [ ] Create test domains with known warnings
- [ ] Test Chrome microservice with sample domains
- [ ] Test WebKit microservice with sample domains
- [ ] Test error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Verify database entries

### Days 4-5: Deployment and Documentation
- [ ] Finalize Docker configurations
- [ ] Test the complete system in a staging environment
- [ ] Create deployment documentation
- [ ] Update project documentation
- [ ] Prepare for production deployment

## Key Milestones

1. **End of Week 1**: Basic infrastructure and project setup complete
2. **End of Week 2**: Domain consumers and browser integration implemented
3. **End of Week 3**: Warning detection and processing logic complete
4. **End of Week 4**: System tested and ready for deployment

## Resource Requirements

- 1-2 Backend developers familiar with NestJS and TypeScript
- DevOps support for Docker and Kafka configuration
- QA resources for testing with various domains

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Browser detection patterns may change | Warning detection may fail | Implement flexible detection patterns and regular updates |
| High resource usage by browser instances | Performance degradation | Implement proper browser context management and resource limits |
| Kafka message processing failures | Data loss | Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms |
| False positives/negatives in warning detection | Incorrect data | Thorough testing with various domain types and regular validation |

## Conclusion

This timeline provides a structured approach to implementing the domain sentinel microservices. The phased implementation allows for incremental development and testing, ensuring a robust and reliable system.

By following this timeline, the development team can efficiently implement the microservices while maintaining code quality and ensuring comprehensive testing.
