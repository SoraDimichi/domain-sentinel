# Domain Sentinel Solution Summary

## Overview

This solution implements two microservices that check domains for deceptive website warnings using different browser engines:

1. **domain-sentinel-chrome**: Uses Playwright with Chrome browser
2. **domain-sentinel-webkit**: Uses Playwright with WebKit browser

Both microservices consume domain messages from the same Kafka queue, check if there are any deceptive website warnings when visiting the domains, and write the results to a feed schema.

## Key Components

### 1. Feed Schema

A simple schema to store domain warning check results:

- `domain_id`: The ID of the domain being checked
- `has_warning`: Boolean indicating if a warning was detected
- `browser_type`: The browser used for checking (chrome/webkit)

### 2. Microservice Architecture

Each microservice:

- Consumes domain batches from Kafka
- Processes each domain individually
- Uses Playwright to automate browser checks
- Detects deceptive website warnings
- Saves results to the feed schema

### 3. Browser Integration

Playwright is used to automate browser interactions:

- **Chrome**: Uses Playwright's Chromium browser
- **WebKit**: Uses Playwright's WebKit browser

### 4. Warning Detection

Each microservice implements browser-specific logic to detect deceptive website warnings:

- Checks for warning page elements
- Examines page title and content
- Identifies security warnings

## Implementation Approach

1. **Modular Design**: Each microservice is independent and can be scaled separately
2. **Shared Code**: Common code is shared between microservices where appropriate
3. **Containerization**: Docker is used for deployment
4. **Resilience**: Error handling and logging are implemented throughout

## Benefits

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Checking with multiple browsers provides better coverage
2. **Scalability**: Each microservice can be scaled independently
3. **Reliability**: Individual domain processing ensures accurate results
4. **Maintainability**: Clean separation of concerns makes the system easy to maintain

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. Create the feed schema migration
2. Set up the microservice project structures
3. Implement the domain consumers
4. Integrate Playwright for browser automation
5. Implement warning detection logic
6. Create Dockerfiles and update docker-compose.yml
7. Test with sample domains
